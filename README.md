# Cloud Foundation Toolkit - Fabric

The Cloud Foundation Fabric provides end-to-end Terraform code examples for prototyping on GCP. Code from this repository can be used as the basis for starting to develop an infrastructure as code repository for GCP before adopting production-grade Cloud Foundation Toolkit modules.

The Fabric repository is designed to be adapted and updated for your use cases. For production use cases infrastructure, alternative Cloud Foundation Toolkit modules should be considered or integrated.
