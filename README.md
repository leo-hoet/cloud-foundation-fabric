# Cloud Foundation Toolkit - Fabric

The Cloud Foundation Fabric provides end-to-end Terraform code examples for prototyping on GCP.
Code from this repository can be used as the basis for rapid prototyping of networking and organizational design,
and to lay the automated foundations for adopting additional CFT modules.

The Fabric repository is designed to be adapted and updated for your use cases.
For full-featured support out of the box, alternative Cloud Foundation Toolkit modules should be considered or integrated.
