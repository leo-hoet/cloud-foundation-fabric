# GKE Multitenant stage

TODO: one paragraph description

This directory contains

- a reference [`dev` environment](./dev/) that can be used as-is, and cloned with few changes to implement further environments
- the [GKE stage "module"](./_module) that implements the underlying stage and is then wrapped for specific environments or configurations like `dev` above

Refer to the example [`dev/README.md`](./dev/README.md) for configuration details.
